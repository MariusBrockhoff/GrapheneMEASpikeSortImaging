Codes and examples to publication "Graphene microelectrode arrays, four-dimensional structured illumination microscopy, and a machine learning-based spike sorting algorithm permit the analysis of ultrastructural neuronal changes in a model of Niemann-Pick disease type C"

## Prerequisites
You will need the following to run our code:
* Python 3.8
* Weights and Biases (https://wandb.ai)

## Getting started
Launch a virtual environment and install all required packages. We recommend usage of Conda (if not installed, use `pip install conda`). To setup the virtual environment and install all neccessary packages, follow these steps from the root directory.:
1. To setup a conda envinronment (named myenv) using Python 3.8:
  `conda create -n myenv python=3.8`
2. Activate the virtual environment:
  `conda activate myenv`
3. Install all required packages in the virtual envirnoment:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
